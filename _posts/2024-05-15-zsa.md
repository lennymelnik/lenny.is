title: ZSA Voyager | Part 1
---
So my new keyboard arrived today, its the zsa voyager. Typing on this keyboard feels great, but definitly an adjustment. As I am typing on it right now I am mostly having Issues with the bottom row.

Let me switch over to my regular keyboard now, the sentence above took me what felt like forever to write, but it was definitly funner and more comfrtable on my forearms.

ZSA has made it an amazing customer experience so far with both their customer outreach as well as their packaging. The suite of tools included are fantastic (software).

I have been playing some of the Wack a key and I think it 100% will ve what gets me more comfortable with this keyboard.

Since I have been learning and using NVIM lately I think it may take me longer to start coding on this keyboard, but I have no doubt I will get there soon and enjoy it.
