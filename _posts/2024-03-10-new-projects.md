For a while I have been feeling like something is missing. But I never had the time or emotional range to feel it becuase I was so stuck in a dead end routine. This was not something I could control as I had to commute 3-4ish hours per day. It took away my sleep, time to relax, and time to figure out and work on myself.

But as of today I have officially finished my new move in! We are renting an apartment in an amazing area and to say life has turned around is an understatement. I feel amazing.

So amazing that I decided that I had the time and energy to pursue contuinig education, I am currently in the process of applying for an online MS in Cybersecurity Policy from Georgia Tech. I am very nervous as I really want to get in and I think it will be a major next step of my life (alongside of work ofcourse).

But since I have not been admitted yet and regardless it starts in August I started thinking of different challenges I can do.

Finding new projects has never been a problem, but sticking through with them ended up being an issue. Not because I did not want to work on them, but because I had usually started them with the purpose of solving a need for a specific person or group, who ended up just not using them. So lately I pivoted, instead of building out every demand I started using what I learned from work. Doing intense discover and scoping, defining exactly what needs to be done and why and then delivering on that.

While I was on my commute today (Had to go back to the old appartment to pick up some last things), I came up with a few other ideas I am very excited about.

Firstly is a fun little site where you are shown realistic emails and need to click on what in the email inidicates it is a phishing email (misspelling, wrong dates, wrong domain, old logo, etc). Which I think could just be fun to make and could have some usecase.

The second project is a behavior biometric identifyier. I want to be able to identify who (or more importantly who is not using) a computer based on the behavior of the inputs, such as keyboard and mouse. While this project could serve some value, I really am just excited to build it for the process. To learn, challenge myself, and hopefully document the process.

I do have to say I havent felt this kind of drive and energy in a while and I am so thankfull to have it back.
