# Whats going on with FujiFilm?

I've been into cameras for a while, but I had never ventured or leaned into the world of FujiFilm.

I was interested in picking up a camera thats small enough I can take it with me everywhere, but still produce great and high quality photos.

FujiFilm picked up my attention due to the smaller form factor, as well as their film simulations which are basically baked in filters/colors based on the phiscical films FujiFilm used to manufacutre and their unqiue qualties.

Fun fact, FujiFilm suffered a cybersecurity attack but due to what looks like great cybersecurity they never paid a ransom, just restored from backup. Now that gives me hope for the world of cybersecurity.


# Why am I writing this

Well, I need to learn about the FujiFilm ecosystem, and I figured why not write down what I find? Maybe it will be helfull for someone else in this swarm of model numbers, mark II's and other.

# My observations

- Everyone is grifiting right now. Not sure if people are understanding the differences between V1's and V2's etc, and are pricing their V1's at V2 prices.
