I used to really be into thinkpads. I had my X220 and X220t that I used daily, they were so good I even sold my M1 Macbook (I have since then purchased the M2 15" Air).

But after a while they really started to get dated, the batterly life was diminishing, keyboard felt off, and mostly the screens were lacking. My friend gave me 8th gen Dell he had laying around last year and that was so much better.

Lately I have gotten this craving to use some other machines, to have something just for fun, not work. After re-familiarizing myself with the ThinkPad subreddit I kept noticing people discussing the T440P and a couple of YouTube videos later I knew I wanted one.

These are the reasons:
1. 14 Inch Screen (Upgradable easily to 1080p)
2. 2 non-soldered Ram slots (Although only 16gb total)
3. SOCKETED PROCESSOR (this one blew my mind)
4. Replaceable trackpad (The only thing this model has that is horrible (the trackpack not the ability to upgrade it))
5. Oldish keyboard
6. Oldish Thinkpad design


I was browsing on ebay but only saw $80+ dollar ones that were in poor condition. Tried to bid on a lot of 2 for 90 but lost that one, as well as my hope.

The next day I was on ebay again, and I saw what I knew would be my T440P, spectacular condition and spectacular price ADD PRICE HERE, SHOW SCRENSHOT

So it arrived, and within 10 minutes I had upgraded the RAM, Screen, and Storage. So fast that I was shocked. I am currently writing this post on the T440p which looks AMAZING with the 1080P screen. And this keyboard is just the chefs kiss.

I stowed away the old screen just incase.

The next day my thermal paste arrived and the processor upgrade could not have been easier. The CPU is locked in with a star screw but I just used the end of some scissors. Just need to rotate that screw <180 degrees and you are good to go (After removing the heatsink with 4 regular captive screws.)

Obviously I am not expecting to be able to game on this computer, but now it can actually work really well for my daily usecases. But this time I'll make sure to hold onto my Mac.
