The other day, I was feeling anxious and wanted to step out of the house. Specifically I wanted to take my new camera for a spin and enjoy detatching from what was stressing me out and have a date with myself. 

As soon as I stepped out of the house it got much worse, I was surrounded by people, too self concious to take any photos. I walked a block and then gave up and came back.

I realized that in order for me to get confortable and relaxed enough to take some nice photos, I need to ease myself into it.

I know myself pretty well, and I know that I am extremely 'self-concious' and overthinking my surroundings. With too many people around me and walking the streets I could not focus and was just worried about not getting in someones way.

As I walked home disapointed I came up with an idea, what if I went out when there were no people?

I had done this before when I wake up early in the weekend and just walk the city. Why not do it again, and this time take photos?

That's exactly what I did this morning and had an amazing time.

Here are some of the photos I took:
