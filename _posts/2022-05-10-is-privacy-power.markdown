  Often times when engaging in discussion about privacy and security. I hear the phrase “Privacy is Power”. However I think it is actually the opposite. Before I go about disproving this notion, let me explain what privacy is.

Privacy is control, but in a very limited sense. It is the level control you possess over your own data

Power is a whole different story. Power is the ability to influence others or affect the world around you. Privacy means interacting with the world less. Therefore the more privacy you have, the less power you have.

Instead of those with privacy having power. The entities who possess the data of those without privacy are the ones who have the power. They don’t just have control over themselves, they have control over the others

I also feel like power is more correlated with affecting the majority rather than on an individual level. Just like Facebook even as a non-citizen of a country has more power and influence than a citizen with the most privacy in that country.

In fact, the more privacy you have, the less change you can affect. No one would even listen to you without you needing the disclosing more information, thereby loosing your privacy.
