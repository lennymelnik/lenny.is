ProjectPath is an app designed to help you break down projects into prioritized, actionable tasks. I kept running into the same problem: I was working on projects but never quite sure what my next steps should be. So I built ProjectPath—and started using it while I was building it. By capturing all the context for your project (goals, milestones, existing notes), ProjectPath generates the next steps you need to move closer to your objective, all presented in a clean, intuitive interface.

> **Key Features:**  
> - **AI-powered task generation:** Context-aware prompts create focused, relevant tasks.  
> - **Priority scoring:** Each task is scored so you always know what to tackle next.  
> - **Streamlined UI:** No distractions—just a clear view of your project roadmap.  
> - **Seamless workflow:** Easily add or adjust context as your project evolves.  

Although it’s still rough around the edges, ProjectPath has already helped me stay focused and make real progress. With the increased context capabilities coming from Gemini models, I can’t wait to expand its intelligence and offer even smarter recommendations in the next version.
