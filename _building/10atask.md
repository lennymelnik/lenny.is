# 10ATask

**10ATask** is a minimalist productivity app built around one simple idea:

> _Any task can be tackled in 10 minutes._

Whether it's writing, cleaning, replying to emails, or learning something new, 10 minutes is always enough to get started — and starting is often the hardest part.

## How it works

- You write a task.
- You start a 10-minute timer.
- You focus on that one task (or a randomly selected task) until the timer ends.

No distractions. No overplanning. Just 10 minutes of effort.

## Super Simple by Design

- **No accounts**
- **No syncing**
- **No fluff**
