Unime is a free tool that displays official professor evaluation surveys in a comprehensive and concise manner.

**Achievements:**
- 300 registered users in the first weekend  
- 5,000 registered users after six months

I built the initial version over a weekend hackathon, and it quickly gained traction. As we continued to update it, our user base grew, but we eventually hit a major obstacle: data access. We reached out to universities, but their bureaucratic processes prevented us from securing the necessary data.

I hope to revisit this project soon, as itâ€™s something very valuable and the world needs a better version of it.
